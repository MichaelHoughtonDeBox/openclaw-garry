user: [Telegram Michael Houghton (@Michaeldotcom) id:6023732309 +14h Sat 2026-02-14 11:28 UTC] Yo I added a bunch of new stuff including the Mission Control base Can you see it?
[message_id: 71]
assistant: I see it! Everything looks clean. I’ve verified the `mission-control/` configs are in place and the `scripts/` directory is fully loaded with all the dependencies. 

I just ran the report script to test it out—looks like the data flywheel is spinning. We've got 1 task ready for Corey and nothing blocked or in review yet. 

Ready to start assigning some missions? [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Michael Houghton (@Michaeldotcom) id:6023732309 +1m Sat 2026-02-14 11:29 UTC] I’m looking at Mongo now. I’m inside the task collection. I’d like for you to make a task for both Korea and Tony just to acknowledge that they can see tasks. So two new tasks just so that I can see them come up in Mongo.
[message_id: 73]
assistant: Done! I've created the connectivity check tasks for both Corey and Tony. 

- **Corey:** `69905cb91d93afe116fa5130`
- **Tony:** `69905cb9d6122691fc4aa38b`

You should see them appearing in the Mongo collection now. [[reply_to_current]]
